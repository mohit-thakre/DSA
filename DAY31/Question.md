# Day 31: Questions

## Question 91:Add 1 to a Linked List Number

**Problem:**  
You are given a linked list where each element in the list is a node and have an integer data. You need to add 1 to the number formed by concatinating all the list node numbers together and return the head of the modified linked list.

Example
Input: LinkedList: 4->5->6
Output: 457

Explanation: 4->5->6 represents 456 and when 1 is added it becomes 457.

Input: LinkedList: 1->2->3
Output: 124

Explanation: 1->2->3 represents 123 and when 1 is added it becomes 124.

## Question 92: Reverse a Linked List(recursively)

**Problem:**  
Given the head of a singly linked list, write a program to reverse the linked list, and return the head pointer to the reversed list.

Examples
Example 1:

Input Format:

LL: 1 3 2 4

Output: 3

Explanation: After reversing the linked list, the new head will point to the tail of the old linked list.

Example 2:

Input Format:

LL: 4

Output: 4

Explanation: In this example, the linked list contains only one node hence reversing this linked list will result in the same list as the original.

## Question 93: Merge Two Unsorted Linked Lists

**Problem:**  
Given the heads of two unsorted singly linked lists, write a program to merge them into a single linked list.

Examples
Example 1:

Input Format:

LL1: 3 1 4  
LL2: 2 5 6

Output: 3 1 4 2 5 6

Explanation: After merging the two linked lists, the new linked list will contain all the nodes from both lists.

Example 2:

Input Format:

LL1: 7  
LL2: 8 9

Output: 7 8 9

Explanation: In this example, the first linked list contains only one node and the second linked list contains two nodes. After merging, the new linked list will contain all the nodes from both lists.
