## Question 58: Isomorphic Strings

**Problem:**  
Given two strings s and t, determine if they are isomorphic.

Two strings s and t are isomorphic if the characters in s can be replaced to get t.

All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character, but a character may map to itself.

Example 1:

Input: s = "egg", t = "add"

Output: true

Explanation:

The strings s and t can be made identical by:

Mapping 'e' to 'a'.
Mapping 'g' to 'd'.
Example 2:

Input: s = "foo", t = "bar"

Output: false

Explanation:

The strings s and t can not be made identical as 'o' needs to be mapped to both 'a' and 'r'.

Example 3:

Input: s = "paper", t = "title"

Output: true

## Question 59: Longest Common Prefix

**Problem:**  
Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings.
If there is no common prefix, return an empty string "".

Example 1:

Input: strs = ["flower","flow","flight"]
Output: "fl"
Example 2:

Input: strs = ["dog","racecar","car"]
Output: ""
Explanation: There is no common prefix among the input strings.

## Question 60: Rotate String

**Problem:**  
Given two strings s and goal, return true if and only if s can become goal after some number of shifts on s.
A shift on s consists of moving the leftmost character of s to the rightmost position.

Example 1:

Input: s = "abcde", goal = "cdeab"
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: s = "abcde", goal = "abced"
Output: false
