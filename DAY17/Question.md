## Question 49: Search Element in Rotated Sorted Array II

**Problem:**  
Given an integer array arr of size N, sorted in ascending order (may contain duplicate values) and a target value k. Now the array is rotated at some pivot point unknown to you. Return True if k is present and otherwise, return False.

Example 1:
Input Format:
arr = [7, 8, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6], k = 3
Result:
True
Explanation:
The element 3 is present in the array. So, the answer is True.

Example 2:
Input Format:
arr = [7, 8, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6], k = 10
Result:
False
Explanation:
The element 10 is not present in the array. So, the answer is False.

## Question 50: Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array

**Problem:**  
 Given an integer array arr of size N, sorted in ascending order (with distinct values). Now the array is rotated between 1 to N times which is unknown. Find the minimum element in the array.

Example 1:
Input Format:
arr = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2,3]
Result:
0
Explanation:
Here, the element 0 is the minimum element in the array.

Example 2:
Input Format:
arr = [3,4,5,1,2]
Result:
1
Explanation:
Here, the element 1 is the minimum element in the array.

## Question 51: Find out how many times the array has been rotated

**Problem:**  
Given an integer array arr of size N, sorted in ascending order (with distinct values). Now the array is rotated between 1 to N times which is unknown. Find how many times the array has been rotated.

Example 1:
Input Format:
arr = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2,3]
Result:
4
Explanation:
The original array should be [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7]. So, we can notice that the array has been rotated 4 times.

Example 2:
Input Format:
arr = [3,4,5,1,2]
Result:
3
Explanation:
The original array should be [1,2,3,4,5]. So, we can notice that the array has been rotated 3 times.
