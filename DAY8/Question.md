# Day 8: Questions

## Question 23: Rotate array by K elements

**Problem:**  
 Given an array of integers, rotating array of elements by k elements either left or right.
Example 1:
Input: N = 7, array[] = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7} , k=2 , right
Output: 6 7 1 2 3 4 5
Explanation: array is rotated to right by 2 position .

Example 2:
Input: N = 6, array[] = {3,7,8,9,10,11} , k=3 , left
Output: 9 10 11 3 7 8
Explanation: Array is rotated to right by 3 position.

## Question 24: Move all Zeros to the end of the array

**Problem:**  
You are given an array of integers, your task is to move all the zeros in the array to the end of the array and move non-negative integers to the front by maintaining their order.

Example 1:
Input:
1 ,0 ,2 ,3 ,0 ,4 ,0 ,1
Output:
1 ,2 ,3 ,4 ,1 ,0 ,0 ,0
Explanation:
All the zeros are moved to the end and non-negative integers are moved to front by maintaining order

Input:
1,2,0,1,0,4,0
Output:
1,2,1,4,0,0,0
Explanation:
All the zeros are moved to the end and non-negative integers are moved to front by maintaining order
