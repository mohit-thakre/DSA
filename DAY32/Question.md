push(34)
top()
size()
pop()

Output:

The element pushed is 4
The element pushed is 14

## Question 93: Merge Two Unsorted Linked Lists

**Problem:**  
Given the heads of two unsorted singly linked lists, write a program to merge them into a single linked list.

Examples
Example 1:

Input Format:

LL1: 3 1 4  
LL2: 2 5 6

Output: 3 1 4 2 5 6

Explanation: After merging the two linked lists, the new linked list will contain all the nodes from both lists.

Example 2:

Input Format:

LL1: 7  
LL2: 8 9

Output: 7 8 9

Explanation: In this example, the first linked list contains only one node and the second linked list contains two nodes. After merging, the new linked list will contain all the nodes from both lists.
