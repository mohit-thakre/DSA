# Day 15: Questions

## Question 44: Search Insert Position

**Problem:**  
 You are given a sorted array arr of distinct values and a target value x. You need to search for the index of the target value in the array.

If the value is present in the array, then return its index. Otherwise, determine the index where it would be inserted in the array while maintaining the sorted order.

Example 1:
Input Format: arr[] = {1,2,4,7}, x = 6
Result: 3
Explanation: 6 is not present in the array. So, if we will insert 6 in the 3rd index(0-based indexing), the array will still be sorted. {1,2,4,6,7}.

Example 2:
Input Format: arr[] = {1,2,4,7}, x = 2
Result: 1
Explanation: 2 is present in the array and so we will return its index i.e. 1.

## Question 45: Floor and Ceil in Sorted Array

**Problem:**  
You're given an sorted array arr of n integers and an integer x. Find the floor and ceiling of x in arr[0..n-1].
The floor of x is the largest element in the array which is smaller than or equal to x.
The ceiling of x is the smallest element in the array greater than or equal to x.

Example 1:
Input Format: n = 6, arr[] ={3, 4, 4, 7, 8, 10}, x= 5
Result: 4 7
Explanation: The floor of 5 in the array is 4, and the ceiling of 5 in the array is 7.

Example 2:
Input Format: n = 6, arr[] ={3, 4, 4, 7, 8, 10}, x= 8
Result: 8 8
Explanation: The floor of 8 in the array is 8, and the ceiling of 8 in the array is also 8.

## Question 46: first or Last occurrence in a sorted array

**Problem:**  
 Given a sorted array of N integers, write a program to find the index of the last occurrence of the target key. If the target is not found then return -1.

Note: Consider 0 based indexing

Example 1:
Input: N = 7, target=13, array[] = {3,4,13,13,13,20,40}
Output: 4
Explanation: As the target value is 13 , it appears for the first time at index number 2.

Example 2:
Input: N = 7, target=60, array[] = {3,4,13,13,13,20,40}
Output: -1
Explanation: Target value 60 is not present in the array
