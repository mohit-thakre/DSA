## Question 79: Reverse a Doubly Linked List

**Problem:**  
 Given a doubly linked list of size ‘N’ consisting of positive integers, your task is to reverse it and return the head of the modified doubly linked list.

Example 1:

Input Format:

DLL: 1 <-> 2 <-> 3 <-> 4

Result: DLL: 4 <-> 3 <-> 2 <-> 1

Explanation: The doubly linked list is reversed and its last node is returned at the new head pointer.

Example 2:

Input Format:

DLL: 10 <-> 20 <-> 30

Result: DLL: 30 <-> 20 <-> 10

Explanation: In this case, the doubly linked list is reversed and its former tail is returned as its new head.

## Question 80: Find middle element in a Linked List

**Problem:**  
Given the head of a linked list of integers, determine the middle node of the linked list. However, if the linked list has an even number of nodes, return the second middle node.

Example 1:
Input: LL: 1 2 3 4 5

Output: 3
Explanation: Node with value 3 is the middle node of this linked list.
Example 2:
Input: LL: 1 2 3 4 5 6

Output: 4
Explanation: In this example, the linked list has an even number of nodes hence we return the second middle node which is 4.

## Question 81: Reverse a Linked List

**Problem:**  
Given the head of a singly linked list, write a program to reverse the linked list, and return the head pointer to the reversed list.

Example 1:

Input Format:

LL: 1 3 2 4

Output: 4

Explanation: After reversing the linked list, the new head will point to the tail of the old linked list.

Example 2:

Input Format:

LL: 4

Output: 4

Explanation: In this example, the linked list contains only one node hence reversing this linked list will result in the same list as the original.
