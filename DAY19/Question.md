## Question 55: Remove Outermost Parentheses

**Problem:**  
Given a valid parenthesis string, remove the outermost parentheses and return the modified string.

Example 1:

Input: s = "(()())(())"
Output: "()()()"
Explanation:
The input string is "(()())(())", with primitive decomposition "(()())" + "(())".
After removing outer parentheses of each part, this is "()()" + "()" = "()()()".
Example 2:

Input: s = "(()())(())(()(()))"
Output: "()()()()(())"
Explanation:
The input string is "(()())(())(()(()))", with primitive decomposition "(()())" + "(())" + "(()(()))".
After removing outer parentheses of each part, this is "()()" + "()" + "()(())" = "()()()()(())".
Example 3:

Input: s = "()()"
Output: ""
Explanation:
The input string is "()()", with primitive decomposition "()" + "()".

## Question 57: Largest Odd Number in String

**Problem:**  
You are given a string num, representing a large integer. Return the largest-valued odd integer (as a string) that is a non-empty substring of num, or an empty string "" if no odd integer exists.

A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.

Example 1:

Input: num = "52"
Output: "5"
Explanation: The only non-empty substrings are "5", "2", and "52". "5" is the only odd number.
Example 2:

Input: num = "4206"
Output: ""
Explanation: There are no odd numbers in "4206".
Example 3:

Input: num = "35427"
Output: "35427"
Explanation: "35427" is already an odd number.
