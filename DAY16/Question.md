# Day 16: Questions

## Question 46: Count Occurrences in Sorted Array

**Problem:**  
You are given a sorted array containing N integers and a number X. You have to find the occurrences of X in the given array.

Example 1:
Input: N = 7, X = 3, array[] = {2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4}
Output: 4
Explanation: 3 is occurring 4 times in the given array, so it is our answer.

Example 2:
Input: N = 8, X = 2, array[] = {1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3}
Output: 5
Explanation: 2 is occurring 5 times in the given array, so it is our answer.

## Question 47: Search Single Element in a sorted array

**Problem:**  
 Given an array of N integers. Every number in the array except one appears twice. Find the single number in the array.

Example 1:
Input Format:
 arr[] = {1,1,2,2,3,3,4,5,5,6,6}
Result:
 4
Explanation:
 Only the number 4 appears once in the array.

Example 2:
Input Format:
 arr[] = {1,1,3,5,5}
Result:
 3
Explanation:
 Only the number 3 appears once in the array.

## Question 48: Search Element in a Rotated Sorted Array

**Problem:**  
Given an integer array arr of size N, sorted in ascending order (with distinct values) and a target value k. Now the array is rotated at some pivot point unknown to you. Find the index at which k is present and if k is not present return -1.



Example 1:
Input Format: arr = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2,3], k = 0
Result: 4
Explanation: Here, the target is 0. We can see that 0 is present in the given rotated sorted array, nums. Thus, we get output as 4, which is the index at which 0 is present in the array.

Example 2:
Input Format: arr = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], k = 3
Result: -1
Explanation: Here, the target is 3. Since 3 is not present in the given rotated sorted array. Thus, we get the output as -1.
