# Day 26: Questions

## Question 76: Search an element in a Linked List

**Problem:**  
 Given the head of a linked list and an integer value, find out whether the integer is present in the linked list or not. Return true if it is present, or else return false.

Example 1:

Input Format: 0->1->2, val = 2

Result True

Explanation: Since element 2 is present in the list, it will return true.

Example 2:

Input Format: 12->5->8->7, val = 6

Result False

Explanation: The list does not contain element 6. Therefore, it returns false.

## Question 77: Insert at end of Doubly Linked List

**Problem:**  
Given a doubly linked list, and a value ‘k’, insert a node having value ‘k’ at the end of the doubly linked list.

Example 1:

Input Format:

DLL: 1 <-> 2 <-> 3 <-> 4

Value to be Inserted: 6

Result: DLL: 1 <-> 2 <-> 3 <-> 4 <-> 6

Explanation: A new node with value 6 has been inserted at the end of the doubly linked list after the tail node.

Example 2:

Input Format:

DLL: 10 <-> 20 <-> 30

Value to be Inserted: 40

Result: DLL: 10 <-> 20 <-> 30 <-> 40

Explanation: In this case, a new node with value 40 is inserted after 30 which is at the end of the doubly linked list.

## Question 78: Delete Last Node of a Doubly Linked List

**Problem:**  
Given a Doubly Linked List. Delete the last of a Doubly Linked List.

Example 1: DLL: 1 <-> 3 <-> 4 <-> 1

Result: DLL: 1 <-> 3 <-> 4

Explanation: After deleting the tail node we will get a doubly linked list. The node at the end of the doubly linked list will no longer be a part of it.

Input Format: DLL: 7 <-> 5

Result: DLL: 7

Explanation: 7 will be the only node left after we delete the tail node of the doubly linked list.
