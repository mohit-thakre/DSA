# Day 25: Questions

## Question 73: Insert at the head of a Linked List

**Problem:**  
Given a linked list and an integer value val, insert a new node with that value at the beginning (before the head) of the list and return the updated linked list.

Example 1:

Input Format: 0->1->2, val = 5

Result: 5->0->1->2

Explanation: We need to insert the value 5 before the head of the given Linked List.

Example 2:

Input Format:12->5->8->7, val = 100

Result: 100->12->5->8->7

Explanation: Again, we need to insert the value 100 before the head of the Linked List.

## Question 74: Delete Last Node of Linked List

**Problem:**  
Problem Statement: Given a linked list, delete the tail of the linked list and print the updated linked list.

Example 1:

Examples:

Input Format: 0->1->2

Result: 0->1

Explanation: The tail of the list is the last node. After removing the tail, and updating the linked list, this result is what we get.

Example 2:

Input Format: 12->5->8->7

Result: 12->5->8

Explanation: Again, after deleting the tail and updating the linked list, the list ends at the second last node, which is the new tail.

## Question 75: Find the Length of a Linked List

**Problem:**  
Given the head of a linked list, print the length of the linked list.

Example 1:

Input Format: 0->1->2

Result: 3

Explanation: The list has a total of 3 nodes, thus the length of the list is 3.

Example 2:

Input Format: 2->5->8->7

Result: 4

Explanation: Again, the list has 4 nodes, hence, the list length is 4.
