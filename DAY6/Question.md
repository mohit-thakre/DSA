## Question 18: Find Second Smallest and Second Largest Element in an array

**Problem:**  
 Given an array, find the second smallest and second largest element in the array. Print ‘-1’ in the event that either of them doesn’t exist.

Example 1:
Input:
[1,2,4,7,7,5]
Output:
Second Smallest : 2
Second Largest : 5
Explanation:
The elements are as follows 1,2,3,5,7,7 and hence second largest of these is 5 and second smallest is 2

Example 2:
Input:[1]
Output:
Second Smallest : -1
Second Largest : -1
Explanation:
Since there is only one element in the array, it is the largest and smallest element present in the array. There is no second largest or second smallest element present.

## Question 19: Check if an Array is Sorted

**Problem:**  
Given an array of size n, write a program to check if the given array is sorted in (ascending / Increasing / Non-decreasing) order or not. If the array is sorted then return True, Else return False.

**Example:**  
Example 1:
Input:
N = 5, array[] = {1,2,3,4,5}
Output
: True.
Explanation:
The given array is sorted i.e Every element in the array is smaller than or equals to its next values, So the answer is True.

Example 2:
Input:
N = 5, array[] = {5,4,6,7,8}
Output
: False.
Explanation:
The given array is Not sorted i.e Every element in the array is not smaller than or equal to its next values, So the answer is False.

Here element 5 is not smaller than or equal to its future elements.
